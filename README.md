Each word has exactly one partner word that is one letter off. It is your job to guess the letter to make the other valid word. The letter to guess is capitalized (e.g. `Buzz` to `FUZZ`, and `aShy` to `ACHY`). Type the letter and hit ENTER to complete the guess.

Give up on a word? Hit ENTER to skip.
